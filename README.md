# AMLS_1_Code
Bagus Raka's repo for UCL AMLS 1 program.

## Note: This repo only tracks my development of the code. I do not include datasets, saved models, etc as there is a storage limit on github.
Update 1: Changed label encoding to one-hot encoding. First attempt task B with CNN algorithm.

Update 2: Made initial data preprocessing for task A and added accuracy metric for task B.

Update 3: First attempt task A with Logistic Regression and cleaned up data preprocessing code.

Update 4: Restructured project foldering. Added general function for testing for both task A and B.

Update 4b: Small fix with pathing.

Update 5: Added SMOTE to oversample 'no_tumor' data, cleaned up code with functions.

Update 6: Added K-fold CV for both task A dan task B.

Update 7: Seperated files for each model. Simplified code by creating a master function .py file, so that each model notebook is shorter and doesn't repeat functions.

Update 7b: deleted old files
