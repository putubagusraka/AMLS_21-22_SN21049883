# AMLS_1_Code
Bagus Raka's repo for UCL AMLS 1 program.

## Note: This repo only tracks my development of the code. I do not include datasets, saved models, etc as there is a storage limit on github.
First Update: Changed label encoding to one-hot encoding. First attempt task B with CNN algorithm.

Second Update: Made initial data preprocessing for task A and added accuracy metric for task B.

Third Update: First attempt task A with Logistic Regression and cleaned up data preprocessing code.

Fourth Update: Restructured project foldering. Added general function for testing for both task A and B.
